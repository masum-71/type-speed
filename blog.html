          1.Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>LocalStorage:</strong> <br />
          Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies,
          providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which
          considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie. The
          data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML,
          images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between
          client and server. The data stored in localStorage persists until
          explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all
          current and future visits to the site​ <br />
          <strong>sessionStorage:</strong> <br />
          It is similar to localStorage. <br />
          Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome
          and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current
          page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once
          the window is closed, the storage is deleted The data is available
          only inside the window/tab in which it was set​

          2.Difference between block scope and local scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Block Scope:</strong> <br />
          Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function
          Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and
          const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables
          declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
          Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
          Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the
          block. <br />
          <strong>Local Scope:</strong> <br />
          Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the
          function. Local variables have Function Scope: They can only be
          accessed from within the function.Since local variables are only
          recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be
          used in different functions. Local variables are created when a
          function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

          3.How does an event loop work in JS ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Event Loop:</strong> <br />
          We often hear that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming
          language, which means it executes all of the instructions line by line
          in a synchronous manner. Thus since everything works on the main
          thread, there seems to be no possibility of executing parallel
          processes in JavaScript. But now let's assume that we have a function
          which is taking some time to execute,for example in the below function which is having a loop over 10k times, the console.log() would be executed once the loop is over and in the meantime, our UI interaction with the browser would be interrupted.
            <br>
         <code>
             function someTimeTakingFunc() { <br>
                for(var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { <br>
              
                } <br>
                console.log("Loop has been executed")
              }
         </code> <br>
          The above scenario seems to be impractical, but there might be cases where any function can take an indeterminate amount of time and our main thread would be blocked, for example calling an API for fetching data from the server-side. And this is the practical use case we are dealing with in development every day. So how JavaScript handles this and where does the event loop come into the picture? We will surely get to know this, but before moving further, let's understand the basic memory architecture in JavaScript.

          4.How  we can get undefined in javascript ?
        </h2>
        <p>
           <ol>
            <li> A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it</li>
            <li> We will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.</li>
            <li> If we pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.</li>
            <li>An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.</li>
           </ol>
